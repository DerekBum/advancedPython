The Ultramarines are considered one of the strongest and most honoured of all the Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium of Man,
and were responsible for almost single-handedly holding the Imperium together after the Horus Heresy.

Highly-disciplined and courageous warriors, the Ultramarines have remained true to the teachings of Primarch Roboute Guilliman for 10,000 standard years.
The Ultramarines were originally the XIIIth Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy
in the Time of Rebirth on the orders of Guilliman himself as the lord commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent.

The name "Ultramarines" is a nod to the Chapter's galactic region of origin, its standing amongst the other Space Marine Chapters
and their role as the source for the gene-seed of more Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes than any of the other former First Founding Legions combined.

The culture of the Ultramarines is loosely themed upon the culture of Old Earth's ancient Roman Empire,
as exemplified in their Astartes' High Gothic names and their strict adherence to the Codex Astartes, as well as the society of their homeworld of Macragge
and the Chapter's method of recruitment. 

The Ultramarines directly rule the sub-sector of space in the Segmentum Ultima of the galactic east known as Ultramar as a fief of the Imperium
and their Chapter Master is also considered the Lord of Macragge and the Master of Ultramar.
