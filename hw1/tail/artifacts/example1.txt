The Kraken bears no resemblance to anything humanoid.
The Kraken's size is roughly that of an entire cliff, and the Kraken's body structure is somewhat similar to a squid.
Multiple giant tentacles stretch out from under the Kraken's colossal head.

The Kraken does have a gigantic mouth, meaning it is possible that The Kraken is an extremely enormous humanoid, though it is highly unlikely.

Inside its head, there are countless tentacles and spikes.
It has multiple tumors throughout its body, which serves as its only vulnerability.
These tumors are larger than the tumors found on a Tank or Mother/Big Mother and have black striations.
They also glow pale pink to red when damage is inflicted on them.

The Kraken acts as a boss enemy for certain expeditions or rundowns.
Its normal habitat seems to be the vast unnamed environment added in Rundown 6.0.
The Kraken emerges from holes or cliffs slowly and its roars to alert the players about its presence.
As soon as it notices the player after opening up and reveling its tentacles, it immediately engages in combat.
